# SystemAnalysisAndDesign
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a driving education program that gets students prepared for their drivers exam through classes, tests and physical driving lessons.  DriverPass 
asked us to design a program that will allow students to take classes, take exams and register for physical driving lessons.  

What did you do particularly well?
The documents in this repository succesfully organize the system to allow for approval from client and eventually transfer to next phase.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
There are still a few more charts that need to be made such as activity charts for the other tasks. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The activity diagram specifically considered the way the user will be interacting with the system.  It is important that the program considers all possible inputs and needs
of the clients to ensure that the program will be well recieved. If the program creates more difficulties for the user the wont want to use the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The first important thing to designing software is to listen to the clients and learn as much as you can about the organization to help build them the best program.  
There will likely be "must haves" for the program and "it would be nice if" parts of the program and as the system designer you need to differentiate the two and
steer the client to whats feasible and cost efficient depending on the clients budget.  A use case diagram is a great starting point after the intiial consultation.
It will show the actors and the actions those actors will need to take and when there is associations for multiple actors for certain tasks.  These diagrams along with
system and activity diagrams help create a well thought through UML class diagram.  The Uml class diagram is what the coders will use to begin to write the program.
